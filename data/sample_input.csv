Scientists predict catastrophic flooding by 2030.","According to the latest IPCC report, global average temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as of 2024. Sea level rise has been measured at approximately 3.4 millimeters per year over the past two decades, totaling about 68 millimeters (6.8 centimeters) since 2004.
